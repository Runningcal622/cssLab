    <h1>Our design</h1>
    <p>
      We decided on the theme of a tree. One design desision we made was to hide the completed
      days as the trunk of the tree. If you want to see the assignments that were due on a particular day, you can hover over it and it will expand.
      As more days go from current to completed, more days will appear at the bottom of the tree, thus growing our tree of knowledge. Some things we had to deal with were the absense of
      ids for each page. This proved to be a problem when the background image covered important information on the classmates page. To counteract this
      we gave each element a background color to try to cover over it. We decided to use clouds as the background for our navigation elements and fix 
      it on the screen so that you can use it even when you are halfway down the classmates page. Continuing with our theme of trees, the sound object
      is now a leaf. We gave every table a border so that t would be easier to tell which data was meant to be grouped together. We added a background
      to the profile picture.
